# CROWDPASS

## OVERVIEW
Crowdpass is a decentralized event management platform that aid event organizers to create and manage events, it also aid event attendees to purchase, sell and get a refund on ticket purchased in the case of event cancelation.

## PROBLEM
The event industry faces several significant inefficiencies that impact both organizers and attendees.

### For Organizers:

1. Ticket Management Issues: 
      - ``Duplication of Tickets``: Malicious actors can duplicate tickets, making it difficult to ensure that each ticket is unique and valid.
      - ``Unaccountable Funds``: There is often a lack of transparency and accountability in ticket sales, leading to potential capital and revenue loss. 

### For Event Attendees:

1. `Fake Tickets`: Attendees risk purchasing counterfeit tickets, which can prevent them from accessing the event.
2. `Refund Insecurities`: If an event is canceled, attendees may face difficulties in getting refunds, creating financial insecurity.

   In summary, event organizers struggle with managing ticket sales, preventing fraud, and ensuring proper revenue tracking, while attendees worry about the authenticity of tickets and the security of their funds in case of event cancellations.

## SOLUTION
`Crowdpass` aims to fix the above inefficiencies by utilizing NFTs to create tickets so attendees own the tickets purchased for an event, unlocking functionalities like reselling of tickets, refund for tickets on event cancellation and so much more.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - Our smartcontract is an escrow contract, that handles all tickets (NFTs) and funds from ticket purchase.
> - Event organizers can monitor but can't claim funds from ticket sales until after the event's end_date.
